## to do list 

http://a3-charlie-roberts.glitch.me

the goal of this application is to create a to-do list for students 

Disclaimer: everything starting falling apart a couple of hours before I submited this assignemnt. There might be a lot of things that don't work properly now but there is code that shows that i meant for it to work/did work in the past. 

I used Bootstrap as my CSS template for the login page due to it's popularity and wide range of use. 

I used Passport.js for authorization because it's what was recommended and hosted the website on Heroku. 

I used these express middleware packages:
- body-parses to read the body data 
- passport for authorization 
- express-session - attempted to use it to get user data before everything started falling  apart
- cors - enables cross-origin resource sharing, used for apis 

Challenges I faced:
I thought everything was going great until I had to incorporate the authentication into the application. After looking at multuple tutorials I kept on digging a never ending hole of bugs. Things that previously worked with no problem suddenly didn't work at all and my internet was being very spotty today which added to the challenges. I also believe that refering to multiple tutorials made me explore a lot of different solutions which eneded up breaking my code even more. I also didn't consider the fact that the wifi in my county might go down the night this assigment was due and that I would be uploading this using my phone data, which made everything a lot slower and stressful.
