Disclaimer: everything starting falling apart a couple of hours before I submited this assignemnt. There might be a lot of things that don't work properly now but there is code that shows that i meant for it to work/did work in the past. 

I used Bootstrap as my CSS template for the login page due to it's popularity and wide range of use. 

I used Passport.js for authorization because it's what was recommended and hosted the website on Heroku. 

I used these express middleware packages:
- body-parses to read the body data 

Challenges I faced:
I thought everything was going great until I had to incorporate the authentication into the application. After looking at multuple tutorials I kept on digging a never ending deeper hole of bugs. Things that previously worked with no problem suddenly didn't work at all and my internet was being very spotty today which added to the challenges. I also believe that refering to multiple tutorials caused me explore a lot of different solutions which eneded up breaking my code even more. 

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does
